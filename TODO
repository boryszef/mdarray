Things that need to be done:

* Let the user read topology and coordinates from separate files - or
  maybe not?
* In read_topo_from_xyz, capitalize symbols before getting atomic number
* Update all internal docs
* Add analyse=True/False to .read()
* If analyse==True, then calculate 'massweighted' coordinates and 'com'
  - center of mass; it's a common operation, not very expensive in C,
  but more expensive in Numpy.
