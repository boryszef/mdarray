Things that need to be done:

* Let the user read topology and coordinates from separate files - or
  maybe not?
* In read_topo_from_xyz, capitalize symbols before getting atomic number
* Update all internal docs
* Perhaps add support for DCD format?
* Add totalMass to Trajectory
* Add checking if mass == -1 -> None
* Add analyse=True/False to .read()
* If analyse==True, then calculate 'massweighted' coordinates and 'com'
  - center of mass; it's a common operation, not very expensive in C,
  but more expensive in Numpy.
* Stuff to possibly port from previous version:
  Molden format support,
  distanceMatrix (with PBC),
  quaternion fit,
  findHBonds,
  moments of inertia,
* Add fixed_width flag, to indicate that XYZ has fixed width format,
  then block reading could be used with index offsets to extract data;
  that would speed up reading.
