Things that need to be done:

* Split opening files and reading single frame into separate functions.
  Reading a huge trajectory at one takes too much time.

* Rewrite readline() using realloc

* Port the code into Python3.

* Code refactoring.

* Parallelize.

* In read_topo_from_xyz, capitalize symbols before getting atomic number
