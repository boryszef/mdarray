mdarray is a Python module for (mostly) reading trajectories from Molecular
Dynamics. The central part of the module is Trajectory class that reads
coordinates from the trajectory (plus some other data), which can be further
processed in Python scripts. The module has been developed with two
assumptions in mind:
* it should be fast and easy to use
* the data should be stored using standard types, so that the user can
  easily build own programs on top of it.
Because of that, each frame read is returned as dictionary with items such
as coordinates, velocities, box, etc. Arrays of numbers are stored using
ndarray type provided by the Numpy package. The choice of Numpy is dictated
by the fact, that the data stored in array can be built directly in C code
as a contiguous C array and is not further transformed by Numpy, but only
interfaced in Python. As a result, reading and processing the data is fast.
Also, Numpy is a versatile package with dozens of functions and operators
that allow fast manipulation of arrays.

The Trajectory class currently supports reading XYZ, GRO and XTC formats,
the latter one only if gromacs library is available in the system. Writting
is supported in XYZ and GRO formats.
